Hello! I am Quantroup, the creator of this site. 

The reason i made this is because i got bored. So don't expect weekly posts (or even at all?)

Now that's out of the way we can discuss other things.

First of all, If you wrote an article and want to publish it here (i don't know who would want this but whatever), you can make a pull request.

Of course be sure add your biography in '\_authors'. it can be an html file.

Regular jekyll formatting rules (the ones mentioned in the official documentation) apply.
